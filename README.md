Note: - You have to unzip the downloaded files to get above mention files.
*  Now go to C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include  and paste the header files here (excluding libmysql.a and libmysql.dll).
*  Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\lib  and paste libmysql.a file here.
*  Go to codeblocks --> file -->new -->project -->console application -->go --> and fill all the required fields.
*  Now go to your project folder --> bin --> debug --> add libmysql.dll here.
*  Copy all the codes of project and paste it in main.cpp of your project folder.
* Go to the setting tab of CodeBlocks --> compiler --> linker setting --> add -->
