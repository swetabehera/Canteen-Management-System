**Follow the steps to include the mysql header and connect to mysql server.**


*  Go to https://www.dropbox.com/s/40h26grtqsggwrg/mysqlheaders.rar?dl=0&file_subpath=%2Fmysqlheaders and download 
      the header file.
* Download libmysql.a from https://www.dropbox.com/s/xj3it1pkhu2wb3h/libmysql.a.zip?dl=0
      
* Download libmysql.dll from https://www.dropbox.com/s/nktlkafhmez7c1o/libmysql.dll.zip?dl=0
      
Note: - You have to unzip the downloaded files to get above mention files.
*  Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include in your Windows system and paste the header files here (except libmysql.a and libmysql.dll).
*  Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\lib  and paste libmysql.a file here.
*  Go to codeblocks --> file --> new --> project --> console application --> go --> fill all the required fields.
*  Go to your project folder --> bin --> debug --> add libmysql.dll here.
*  Copy all the contents of the project and paste it in main.cpp of your project folder.
*  Go to the setting tab of CodeBlocks --> compiler --> linker setting --> add --> C:\Program Files  (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\lib\libmysql.a
*  Go to CodeBlocks --> setting -->compiler --> search directories --> add --> C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include
*  Download XAMPP software and install it.
*  Run the XAMPP control panel as an administrator.
*  Start the apache server first and then mysql server.
*  Click admin button.
*  Your default browser will be open and you can see the database there. i.e localhost/phpmyadmin/
